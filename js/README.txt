NOTE: The fancycharts.js file has some edits made that make the dot chart no longer a percentage, but just a "raw count" chart, and manual changes to the dot size, number of dots per line, etc.

Future: switch to using the regular (not min) code, to make these changes much simpler. Library is very lightweight, using non-minimized shouldn't affect performance too much.
